WOWAPI:
Is the function for strings, numbers or expressions.

Example:
Code:
    wowapi 10
    wowapi "Hello World"
    wowapi 10+4*2

Output:
    10
    Hello World
    18

VARIABLES:
The variables initialize with the use of the $.

Example:
Code:
    $variable = 10
    $var2 = "Hello Berg"
    
    wowapi $variable
    wowapi $var2

Output:
    10
    Hello Berg

KhA (USER INPUT):

KhA is one of the Lakota words for remark or input. In the 0.1 version it takes in only
Strings input from the user and saves it in a variable. 0.1.1 hopefully will hold numerical 
and expression values.

Example:
Code:
    kha "Enter your name:" $name
    
Output:
    Enter your name: [type in name here] Blcksm1th1992
    [returns] Blcksm1th1992
    
IF STATMENTS:
heci, is the Lakota word that closely translates to if. Sense this computer language is heavily
based on BASIC, these will be formatted loosely on traditional if-then statements. ehan is the
the closest traslation to then. ihanke is the end, so we can end the if statements.

Example:
Code:
    heci 1 == 1 ehan
        wowapi "Hello Berg"
    ihanke

Output:
    Hello Berg

Iyapi Language:

    In my school, I wanted to raise intrest in the Lakota Native American Language as well as programming. So, I set out to make a simple interpreter language that can do basic variable handling, function calling, and simple logic.
    The problem was I originally wrote it on a Raspberry Pi in Python. Given the limitation of making an interpreter from an interpreter language, I archived the original langauge and began to write it in C to make it a fast language.
